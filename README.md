# Curriculum Vitae

A project made during further education at School of Design ZÃ¼rich. 
The task was to make a CV for later job applications. The range of the content and visuall design was totally free choosable.

So I decided to make a clean layout, with 3 short chapters. One in which I introduce myself and how my personality is. The other about my strengths and tools I can handle. And the last one about my career history, where I worked, how long, at what position, what my tasks were and what kind of schools and further education I completed.
